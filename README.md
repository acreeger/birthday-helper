What is a Birthday Hack?
-------------

At least two things were true on my birthday in 2013:

1. I wanted to write code, to make something.
2. I had way too many birthday wishes on Facebook to deal with personally

So I did what any lazy programmer would do. I wrote an app to deal with the birthday wishes.

I built and launched it on my birthday (the easiest time to test it), and made a few minor tweaks since. It's a little rough around the edges, but I'm ok with that given it was made in just a few hours.

Roadmap
---------
* Extend this to other social platforms
* Store user prefs in "the cloud" so that any settings/customizations follow you round from device to device.
* Allow greater customization of messages
